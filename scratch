each framework stock unit should be unique and traceable

what causes stocks to be created?
- random event throughout the day
- when a new player joins IE an account gets created we create stock in their location
  -- potential problems of doing it
      * players can abuse this to create inventory
  -- potential solutions
     * players spawn in a random location so gaming it is hard
  -- do we like this trade-off??

- how much should we seed the game with?
  -- we want supply and demmand throught different regions with different inventory
     -- do we just wing it?
  -- do we want overall inventory equal to start?
     * IE react has 500 across regions vue has 500 across regions etc etc
